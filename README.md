### Document Processing Pipeline

Our implementation utilized a multi-stage processing approach for the document corpus:

1. **Text Extraction and Normalization**

   - PDF processing using pdfplumber for consistent text extraction
   - Standardized document formatting with metadata preservation
   - Quality control achieving 97% successful extraction rate

2. **Document Chunking Strategy**

   - 512-token segments with 20-token overlaps
   - Semantic coherence maintenance through sentence-level boundaries
   - Optimized for context preservation and retrieval efficiency

3. **Embedding Generation**
   - TF-IDF vectorization for term importance weighting
   - Cluster analysis for document relationship mapping
   - Dimensional reduction for content relationship visualization

### Knowledge Organization

Our system employs multiple classification approaches to optimize information retrieval:

1. **Hierarchical Ontology**

   - Software systems domain (75.9% coverage)
   - Project management processes (73.4% coverage)
   - Document types classification (67.1% coverage)
   - Safety compliance procedures (27.8% coverage)
   - Business processes (29.1% coverage)

2. **Functional Clustering**
   - Eight distinct document communities identified through k-means clustering
   - Natural language processing for topic modeling
   - Cross-reference validation through MDS and t-SNE analysis

### Query Processing System

The implementation features a sophisticated query handling approach:

1. **Query Understanding**

   - Classification system for retrieval necessity
   - Domain-specific terminology recognition
   - Context-aware query interpretation

2. **Retrieval Mechanism**

   - Hybrid retrieval combining:
     - Sparse retrieval (BM25) for keyword matching
